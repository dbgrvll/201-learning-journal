     <p>
        I have a Bachelor's degree from the University of Vermont. I graduated with both an Economics and an English degree.</br>
        
        I fulfilled all of the requirements for the Economics degree and worked at a stock broker's office because I thought it would be better.</b>

        Over the years, it was my English degree that paid the bills. I progressed from a trainer to a Global Content Manager because of my writing skills.</br>

        My goal is to kick it and to become a fll-stack JavaScript developer. I love the tech industry and would like to grow in it.</br>
