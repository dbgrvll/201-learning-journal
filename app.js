//As a user, I would like to guess the answer to a question that could have many possibilities so that I can have fun with with a guessing game.

//Add a 7th question that has multiple possible correct answers that are stored in an array.

//The guesses will end once the user guesses a correct answer or they run out of attempts.
//Display all the possible correct answers to the user.
//Consider using a loop of some sort for this question.



//As a user, I would like to know my final score so that I can know how well I did.

//Keep track of the total number of correct answers. At the end tell them how many they got correct out of the 7 questions asked.
//In addition to the user stories stated above, continue to use console.logs throughout the code to track the questions that are being asked to the user, and add addtional CSS to style your HTML page.
